![flag-india](https://github.com/Azie88/LP1-Data-Analysis/assets/101363399/33d9e0c6-0b2a-42ce-8473-129932025fec)


This project involved using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to analyze data on startup growth, funding patterns, success rates, regional concentration, and market penetration of the Indian Startup Ecosystem between **2018 and 2021**.

The objective, as a data analyst, was to draw insights on the available data from 4 tables and give actionable insights and recommendations to our team that, hypothetically speaking, wants to venture into the Indian startup market. The project utilized advanced statistical techniques and visualization tools to draw meaningful conclusions and present our findings effectively.

## Process ü™ú

- Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

- Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

- Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

- Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

- Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

- Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

- Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations

## Project Structure üìÇ

- `Dataset/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `.gitignore`: Holds files to be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `Project_notebook.ipynb`: The jupyter notebook with data cleaning, EDA and visualizations
- `README.md`: Project overview, links, highlights, and information.

## Key Insights :chart_with_upwards_trend:

1. India's startup ecosystem is positive and thriving with strong favor towards technological companies
2. Equal opportunities exist for non-technological sectors as well
3. Fintech and edtech sectors are particularly active in the Indian startup ecosystem
4. Mumbai is at the forefront of these developments in fintech and edtech sectors
5. Non-technical industries have a few large investments that skew the mean higher
6. Technical industries have a larger number of smaller investments, driving up the sum.

The Indian startup ecosystem is a vibrant and influential force in the global market. This project provides valuable insights into funding patterns and industry preferences. By leveraging this information, stakeholders can make informed decisions and contribute to the growth and success of startups in India.
